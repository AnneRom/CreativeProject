        We champion continual progress for athletes and sport by taking action to help athletes reach their potential. 
        Every job at NIKE, Inc. is grounded in a team-first mindset, cultivating a culture of innovation and a shared
        purpose to leave an enduring impact. 
        We are expanding sport. Fifty years of listening to athletes, alongside our culture of innovation, has lead us 
        to product and services that are 
        increasingly inclusive and consider body, mind and life. 
        Women are redefining what sport is and the opportunity it represents — and we want to help accelerate the change 
        that they want to see. 
        That’s why we're making a purposeful shift from pure sport to holistic fitness and wellness. Here’s a look at what that means.
